/*Write a function named forEach in the utilities.js file. For educational purposes, DO NOT use the built-in Array.prototype.forEach function mentioned in the callback resource. The goal is to write your own function named forEach. It should:
Use a loop to go through all elements in the points array.
Execute a callback for each element.*/
